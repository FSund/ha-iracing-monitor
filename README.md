# iRacing Home Assistant Monitor

Monitors iRacing session state and sends it to Home Assistant via MQTT.

## Requirements

Uses the [winresource](https://crates.io/crates/winresource) crate to set the icon for the executable, which requires `windres.exe` and `ar.exe` from [mingw-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) (this is probably not required when we use the Wix Toolset).

Uses the [Wix Toolset](https://github.com/wixtoolset/) to build the Windows installer via Github Actions.

## TODO
- [x] Add feature `iced_gui` to disable GUI
- [ ] Avoid iced dependencies (`iced_futures`) when feature iced_gui is disabled
- [x] Move winit event loop messaging into main
- [ ] Option to "run on boot" on Windows (use registry)
- [ ] Consider [cargo-bundle](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-bundle/0.6.1) for creating Linux and Windows installers, adding icons etc.
- [x] Initialize sim monitor from config file on initial startup
- [x] Fix tray icon not updating on UserEvent on Linux. `user_event` and `update_session_state` is called, but the icon or menu does not update.
- [x] Use proper location for config file (%APPDATA% on Windows, XDG_CONFIG_... on Linux)
- [x] Fix double tray icons
- [x] Quitting from tray with GUI does not work (Windows)
- [x] Quitting from GUI does throws errors (Windows)
- [x] Figure out where the tray icon went for GUI mode (Windows and Linux)
- [x] Fix sim_monitor stops responding/stream dies if an invalid mqtt config is provided
- [x] Separate backend and frontend
- [x] Fix config update when config file is changed (does not seem to work at the moment, default config is always returned)
- [x] Config file to retain settings between runs
- [ ] Encrypt mqtt password in config file
- [x] Settings pages
- [x] Log to file (only when flag is set?) (--)
- [x] Linux/dev-mode (that doesn't depend on running on Windows)
- [x]Â Add Windows taskbar icon
- [x] Separate main page and settings page in gui
- [x] Windows installer
