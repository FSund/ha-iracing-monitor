# iRacing Home Assistant Monitor

## TODO
- [x] Figure out where the tray icon went for GUI mode (Windows and Linux)
- [x] Fix sim_monitor stops responding/stream dies if an invalid mqtt config is provided
- [x] Separate backend and frontend
- [x] Fix config update when config file is changed (does not seem to work at the moment, default config is always returned)
- [x] Config file to retain settings between runs
- [ ] Encrypt mqtt password in config file
- [x] Settings pages
- [x] Log to file (only when flag is set?) (--)
- [x] Linux/dev-mode (that doesn't depend on running on Windows)
- [x] Add Windows taskbar icon
- [x] Separate main page and settings page in gui
- [ ] Installer
  - [ ] Run as service? Or just "run on boot" option?
